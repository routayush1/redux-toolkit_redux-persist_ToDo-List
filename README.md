> Before you continue, try the demo:  <br />

> Add a few items to the list.
Check-off your todos and navigate the footer to filter for Active/Completed.
Try and "break" it! Refresh the page and notice how your todo items
are "still there" (_they were saved to `localStorage`!_).
Once you have had a "play" with the demo, come back and _build_ it!!

### Todo List?

If you are _unfamiliar_ with Todo lists, simply put:
they are a way of keeping a list of the tasks that need to be done. <br />
see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management#Setting_priorities_and_goals

Todo Lists or "Checklists" are the _best_ way of tracking tasks. <br />
Atul Gawande wrote a _superb_ book on this subject: <br />

## _Who?_
This repo is for anyone/everyone who wants
to see how Redux Toolkit and Redux Persist works
while viewing a "real world" Todo List Application.

### Prerequisites
Most beginners with basic  and HTML knowledge
should be able to follow this example without any prior experience.
The code is commented and the most "complex" function is an event listener.
With that said, if you feel "stuck" at any point,
please consult the recommend reading (_and Google_)
and if you cannot find an answer,
please open an issue!


## _How?_
Start by cloning this repository to your `localhost`
so that you can follow the example/tutorial offline:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/routayush1/redux-toolkit_redux-persist_ToDo-List.git
```
Install the `devDependencies` so you can run the tests:
```sh
 npm install
```
Now you have _everything_ you need to start this Todo List !
```sh
 npm start
```
